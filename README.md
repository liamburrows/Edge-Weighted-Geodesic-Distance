This is an implementation of the geodesic distance in both 2D and 3D first defined in [1] for selective segmentation. The code is implemented in c++ with usage in MATLAB. The geodesic distance involves solving the Eikonal equation. This repositry implements the fast sweeping method [2].

First compile the mex files by running 'compile_mex.m'

Then geodesic distance can be calculated on a 2D or 3D (greyscale) image by running geodesic2D(image) or geodesic3D(image) respectively. 

Edge weighted geodesic distance was first defined in [1] for selective segmentation, and has since been used in a number of works including [1,
